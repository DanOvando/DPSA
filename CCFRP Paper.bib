Generic management procedures for data-poor fisheries: forecasting with few data. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst232. The majority of fish stocks worldwide are not managed quantitatively as they lack sufficient data, particularly a direct index of abundance, on which to base an assessment. Often these stocks are relatively \textquotedblleft{}low value\textquotedblright{}, which renders dedicated scientific management too costly, and a generic solution is therefore desirable. A management procedure (MP) approach is suggested where simple harvest control rules are simulation tested to check robustness to uncertainties. The aim of this analysis is to test some very simple \textquotedblleft{}off-the-shelf\textquotedblright{} MPs that could be applied to groups of data-poor stocks which share similar key characteristics in terms of status and demographic parameters. For this initial investigation, a selection of empirical MPs is simulation tested over a wide range of operating models (OMs) representing resources of medium productivity classified as severely depleted, to ascertain how well these different MPs perform. While the data-moderate MPs (based on an index of abundance) perform somewhat better than the data-limited ones (which lack such input) as would be expected, the latter nevertheless perform surprisingly well across wide ranges of uncertainty. These simple MPs could well provide the basis to develop candidate MPs to manage data-limited stocks, ensuring if not optimal, at least relatively stable sustainable future catches.},

The assessment paradigm has difficulty in providing management for data-poor stocks, and we illustrate this in the New Zealand context. In contrast, the procedural paradigm has the potential to be useful for the data-poor stocks. However, to date, it has not served data-poor fisheries well because most of the development of management procedures has been for high-value, data-rich stocks. This may be because several aspects of the procedural paradigm are misunderstood or neglected. Giving appropriate attention to these aspects will improve the application of fisheries management procedures, particularly for data-poor stocks. For example, more attention needs to be given to the method for presenting evaluation results to decision makers in ways that more easily allow them to make trade-offs among multiple management objectives. We also argue that the design, evaluation, and selection of management procedures should be treated as an exercise in engineering, particularly by applying generic solutions to data-poor cases for which specific solutions are usually not readily developed.},

  abstract = {Legislative changes in the United States and elsewhere now require scientific advice on catch limits for data-poor fisheries. The family of stock reduction analysis (SRA) models is widely used to calculate sustainable harvest levels given a time series of harvest data. SRA works by solving the catch equation given an assumed value for spawning biomass relative to unfished levels in the final (or recent) year, and resulting estimates of recent fishing mortality are biased when this assumed value is mis-specified. We therefore propose to replace this assumption when estimating stock status by using compositional data in recent years to estimate a catch curve and hence estimating fishing mortality in those years. We compare this new \textquotedblleft{}catch-curve stock reduction analysis\textquotedblright{} (CC-SRA) with an SRA or catch curve using simulated data for slow or fast life histories and various magnitudes of recruitment variability. Results confirm that the SRA yields biased estimates of current fishing mortality given mis-specified information about recent spawning biomass, and that the catch curve is biased due to changes in fishing mortality over time. CC-SRA, by contrast, is approximately unbiased for low or moderate recruitment variability, and less biased than other methods given high recruitment variability. We therefore recommend CC-SRA as a data-poor assessment method that incorporates compositional data collection in recent years, and suggest future management strategy evaluation given a data-poor control rule.},

The complexity and cost of assessment techniques prohibits their application to 90\% of fisheries. Simple generic approaches are needed for the world's small-scale and data-poor fisheries. This meta-analysis of the relationship between spawning potential and the normalized size and age of 123 marine species suggests that the so-called Beverton\textendash{}Holt life-history invariants (BH-LHI; Lm/L\ensuremath{\infty}, M/k, M \texttimes{} Agem) actually vary together in relation to life-history strategy, determining the relationship between size, age, and reproductive potential for each species. Although little realized, the common assumption of unique values for the BH-LHI also implies that all species share the same relationship between size, age, and reproductive potential. This implicit assumption is not supported by this meta-analysis, which suggests that there is considerable but predictable natural variation in the BH-LHI ratios and the relationships between size, age, and reproductive potential that they determine. We believe that this reconceptualization of the BH-LHI has potential to provide a theoretical framework for \textquotedblleft{}borrowing\textquotedblright{} knowledge from well-studied species to apply to related, unstudied species and populations, and when applied together with the assessment technique described by Hordyk et al.

A novel length-based empirical estimation method of spawning potential ratio (SPR), and tests of its performance, for small-scale, data-poor fisheries. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu004. The spawning potential ratio (SPR) is a well-established biological reference point, and estimates of SPR could be used to inform management decisions for data-poor fisheries. Simulations were used to investigate the utility of the length-based model (LB-SPR) developed in Hordyk et al. (this issue. Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L\ensuremath{\infty}, and CVL\ensuremath{\infty}). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries.},

  abstract = {Australia has developed a Harvest Strategy Policy (HSP) for Commonwealth fisheries. A harvest strategy specifies the management actions necessary to achieve defined resource objectives in a given fishery, resulting in a formal and proactive management approach that is transparent to all stakeholders. The objectives of the HSP are defined in terms of target and limit biomass reference points, although proxies can be used. It is a significant challenge, therefore, to develop harvest strategies for most small fisheries, which are typically data-poor, have only basic or no formal stock assessments, and have low Gross Value of Production (GVP). For the small Commonwealth fisheries, even indirect biomass estimates are unavailable and, due to their low GVP, it is unlikely that relevant research will be undertaken to determine reliable biomass estimates in the foreseeable future. This paper provides insight into developing harvest strategy frameworks that reconcile the reality and limitations of small fisheries with the intent of the HSP: to cease or avoid overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, and to maintain stocks at levels corresponding to the maximum economic yield. The process of harvest strategy development is evaluated and general principles for the pragmatic development and implementation of harvest strategies for small, low-value, data-poor fisheries are considered. These general principles include (i) the development of sets of triggers with conservative response levels, with progressively higher data and analysis requirements at higher response levels, (ii) identifying data gathering protocols and subsequent simple analyses to better assess the fishery, (iii) archiving biological data for possible future analysis, and (iv) the use of spatial management, either as the main aspect of the harvest strategy or an augmentation with other measures. The value of an iterative approach involving stakeholders and managers is emphasized. The above principles are illustrated by three case studies from Australia's small Commonwealth fisheries: the Western Deepwater and North West Slope Trawl Fisheries, the Coral Sea Fishery, and the Bass Strait Central Zone Scallop Fishery.},

Many small-scale, nearshore fisheries lack the historical catch and survey information needed for conventional stock-assessment-based management. The potential use of the ratio of the density of fish outside a marine protected area to that inside it each year (the density ratio, DR) in a control rule is evaluated to determine the direction and magnitude of change in fishing effort in the next year. Management strategy evaluation was used to evaluate the performance of this DR control rule (DRCR) for a range of movement rates of larvae and adults and other biological scenarios, and the parameters of the control rule that maximized cumulative catch (over 95 years) for each scenario were found. The cumulative catch under the optimal DRCR was 90\% of the cumulative catch from an optimal constant effort rule (CER). A small range of parameter values for the DRCR produced 75\% or more of the cumulative catch produced from optimal CERs for a variety of assumptions about biology and initial stock status. The optimal DRCR was most sensitive to the movement patterns of larvae and adults and survey variability.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There are differences in perception of the status of fisheries around the world that may partly stem from how data on trends in catches over time have been used. On the basis of catch trends, it has been suggested that about 70\% of all stocks are overexploited due to unsustainable harvesting and 30\% of all stocks have collapsed to \ensuremath{<}10\% of unfished levels. Catch trends also suggest that over time an increasing number of stocks will be overexploited and collapsed. We evaluated how use of catch data affects assessment of fisheries stock status. We analyzed simulated random catch data with no trend. We examined well-studied stocks classified as collapsed on the basis of catch data to determine whether these stocks actually were collapsed. We also used stock assessments to compare stock status derived from catch data with status derived from biomass data. Status of stocks derived from catch trends was almost identical to what one would expect if catches were randomly generated with no trend. Most classifications of collapse assigned on the basis of catch data were due to taxonomic reclassification, regulatory changes in fisheries, and market changes. In our comparison of biomass data with catch trends, catch trends overestimated the percentage of overexploited and collapsed stocks. Although our biomass data were primarily from industrial fisheries in developed countries, the status of these stocks estimated from catch data was similar to the status of stocks in the rest of the world estimated from catch data. We conclude that at present 28\textendash{}33\% of all stocks are overexploited and 7\textendash{}13\% of all stocks are collapsed. Additionally, the proportion of fished stocks that are overexploited or collapsed has been fairly stable in recent years.},

Data requirements include estimates of historical annual catches, approximate natural mortality rate and age at maturity. A production function is specified based on general fishery knowledge of the relative location of maximum productivity and the relationship of MSY fishing rate to the natural mortality rate. This leaves unfished biomass as the only unknown parameter, which can be estimated given a designated relative depletion level near the end of the time series. The method produces probability distributions of management reference points concerning yield and biomass. Uncertainties in natural mortality, stock dynamics, optimal harvest rates, and recent stock status are incorporated using Monte Carlo exploration.

  abstract = {Abstract Catch-curve analysis is one of the simplest methods for stock assessment and is widely applied in data-poor fisheries. Conventional catch-curve methods rely on the strong assumptions of constant fishing and natural mortality rates above some fully selected age that is usually estimated by visually inspecting a plot of catch at age. Here, we evaluate the performance of three catch-curve methods that relax or modify these assumptions by (1) estimating logistic selectivity parameters, (2) assuming Lorenzen-form natural mortality (natural mortality that decreases with weight), and (3) using both methods simultaneously. We used simulation modeling and decision tables to compare estimates of fishing mortality from four catch-curve methods, including the conventional method, across a variety of observable and unobservable data characteristics. We then applied the methods to catch-at-age data for Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus from the U.S. South Atlantic fishery management region and compared the resulting estimates with published estimates of fishing mortality (F). In our simulation modeling, catch curves that estimated logistic selectivity parameters performed better than those derived by the conventional method when logistic selectivity was present. There was generally little difference in performance between estimates assuming constant natural mortality and those assuming Lorenzen natural mortality. The improvements from estimating selectivity parameters were particularly pronounced when the sample sizes for catch-at-age data were large: in those instances, estimating selectivity improved the estimation accuracy for F by nearly 20\%. In our example involving Atlantic menhaden, estimates of F assuming logistic selectivity were most similar to those of published stock assessments, which had previously estimated logistic selectivity at age. We recommend our logistic-selectivity catch curve when selectivity is likely to be logistic because it improves accuracy at only a very small cost in terms of computational complexity.

  abstract = {Abstract The Magnuson\textendash{}Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires active management of all stocks at risk of overfishing or otherwise in need of conservation and management. In the Pacific Fishery Management Council groundfish fishery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help define stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments defined a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to fisheries. This work uses productivity\textendash{}susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundfish stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by first using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and flexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stock- and complex-specific management.

  abstract = {Abstract Three common cross-sectional catch-curve methods for estimating total mortality rate (Z) are the Chapman\textendash{}Robson, regression, and Heincke estimators. There are five unresolved methodological issues: (1) which is the best estimator, (2) how one should determine the first age-group to use in the analysis, (3) how the variance estimators perform; and, for regression estimators, (4) how the observations should be weighted, including (5) whether and how the oldest ages should be truncated. We used analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the three catch-curve methods, including unweighted and weighted versions of the regression estimator. We evaluated four criteria for specifying the first age-class used. Regression estimators were evaluated with four different methods of right data truncation. Heincke's method performed poorly and is generally not recommended. The two-tailed \ensuremath{\chi}2 test and one-tailed z-test for full selectivity described by Chapman and Robson did not perform as well as simpler criteria and are not recommended. Estimates with the lowest mean square error were generally provided by (1) the Chapman\textendash{}Robson estimator with the age of full recruitment being the age of maximum catch plus 1 year and (2) the weighted regression estimator with the age of full recruitment being the age of maximum catch and with no right truncation. Differences in performance between the two methods were small (\ensuremath{<}6\% of Z). The Chapman\textendash{}Robson estimator of the variance of had large negative bias when not corrected for overdispersion; once corrected, it performed as well as or better than all other variance estimators evaluated. The regression variance estimator is generally precise and slightly negatively biased. We recommend that the traditional Chapman\textendash{}Robson approach be corrected for overdispersion and used routinely to estimate Z. Weighted linear regression may work slightly better but is completely ad hoc. Unweighted linear regression should no longer be used for analyzing catch-curve data.

  abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem objectives in fisheries management usually flow from high-level national policies or strategies and international agreements. Consequently they are often broadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate directly in management plans. Predicting the results of any management action is very uncertain because the dynamics of ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to design and evaluate operational management strategies have advanced considerably in the past decade. These management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on simulation testing of the whole management process using performance measures derived from operational objectives. The MSE approach involves selecting (operational) management objectives, specifying performance measures, specifying alternative management strategies, and evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework emphasizes the identification and modelling of uncertainties, and propagates these through to their effects on the performance measures. The framework is outlined and illustrated by three ecosystem-related applications: management of benthic habitats and broad fish community composition; by-catch of species of high conservation value; and food-chain interactions and dependencies. Challenges to be overcome before broader ecosystem-related objectives can be fully handled are discussed briefly.},

  isbn = {978-92-5-107993-5},
  abstract = {Stock status is a key parameter for evaluating the sustainability of fishery resources and developing corresponding management plans. However, the majority of stocks are not assessed, often as a result of insufficient data and a lack of resources needed to execute formal stock assessments. The working group involved in this publication focused on two approaches to estimating fisheries status: one based on single-stock status, and the other based on ecosystem production. For the single-stock status work, a fully factorial simulation testing framework was developed to assess four potential data-limited models. The results suggest that Catch-MSY, a catch-based method, was the best performer, although the different models performed similarly in many cases. Catch-MSY was more effective in estimating status over short time scales and could be particularly applicable for use in developing countries where data time series are often shorter. Harvest dynamics was the most important explanatory variable in determining performance, which emphasizes the importance of having accurate information on fishing effort and total removals. For the ecosystem-level production analysis, the working group used satellite-based estimates of primary productivity by size classes and a more complete food web, which included more complete microbial pathways than earlier approaches. The working group also assembled estimates of ecological transfer efficiencies from a large number of energy flow network models to characterize uncertainty. The first-order estimates of fishery production potential indicated a potential yield of up to 180 million tonnes of fish, which could vary depending on the capacity to sustainably diversify the suite of species that are currently exploited. Planktivorous species provide the largest scope for growth. However, consideration of factors such as the ecological impact on other food web components, profitability of harvest operations, and marketability for these species must first be resolved. The realized production potential for planktivores may be much lower than their potential levels depending on the outcome of these considerations. The working group estimated that up to 50 million tonnes of benthic production could be potentially harvested, although this estimate is subject to similar constraints as those for planktivores. The greatest scope for growth in the benthic component may be found in the mariculture sector, subject to suitable environmental safeguards. Ecosystem exploitation rates should not exceed 20\textendash{}25 percent of available production, considering basic energetic constraints in marine ecosystems. Current harvest levels for benthivorous and piscivorous species (principally fish) exceeded these levels in higher-latitude ecosystems (subarcticboreal and temperate) and were near or slightly below them in lower latitudes and upwelling systems. The estimates of the ratio of current catches to available production for planktivorous species are substantially lower, reflecting the production potential of currently underutilized species. However, targeted harvesting of selected planktivorous species does lead to relatively high exploitation rates for some species. Together, these results provide globally applicable methods for estimating fish stock status and fishery production potential.},

NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a build-up of biomass inside their borders while fishing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass.

Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the \textquotedblleft{}true\textquotedblright{} population dynamics.

While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses of field studies have shown that biomass, density, species richness, and size of organisms protected by no-take marine reserves generally increase over time. The magnitude and timing of changes in these response variables, however, vary greatly and depend upon the taxonomic groups protected, size and type of reserve, oceanographic regime, and time since the reserve was implemented. We conducted collaborative, fishery-independent surveys of fishes for seven years in and near newly created marine protected areas (MPAs) in central California, USA. Results showed that initially most MPAs contained more and larger fishes than associated reference sites, likely due to differences in habitat quality. The differences between MPAs and reference sites did not greatly change over the seven years of our study, indicating that reserve benefits will be slow to accumulate in California's temperate eastern boundary current. Fishes in an older reserve that has been closed to fishing since 1973, however, were significantly more abundant and larger than those in associated reference sites. This indicates that reserve benefits are likely to accrue in the California Current ecosystem, but that 20 years or more may be needed to detect significant changes in response variables that are due to MPA implementation. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of fish recruitment patterns, long-term monitoring is needed to identify positive responses of fishes to protection in the diverse set of habitats in a dynamic eastern boundary current. Qualitative estimates of response variables, such as would be obtained from an expert opinion process, are unlikely to provide an accurate description of MPA performance. Similarly, using one species or one MPA as an indicator is unlikely to provide sufficient resolution to accurately describe the performance of multiple MPAs.},

  abstract = {Many methods have been developed in the last 70 years to predict the natural mortality rate, M, of a stock based on empirical evidence from comparative life history studies. These indirect or empirical methods are used in most stock assessments to (i) obtain estimates of M in the absence of direct information, (ii) check on the reasonableness of a direct estimate of M, (iii) examine the range of plausible M estimates for the stock under consideration, and (iv) define prior distributions for Bayesian analyses. The two most cited empirical methods have appeared in the literature over 2500 times to date. Despite the importance of these methods, there is no consensus in the literature on how well these methods work in terms of prediction error or how their performance may be ranked. We evaluate estimators based on various combinations of maximum age (tmax), growth parameters, and water temperature by seeing how well they reproduce \ensuremath{>}200 independent, direct estimates of M. We use tenfold cross-validation to estimate the prediction error of the estimators and to rank their performance. With updated and carefully reviewed data, we conclude that a tmax-based estimator performs the best among all estimators evaluated. The tmax-based estimators in turn perform better than the Alverson\textendash{}Carney method based on tmax and the von Bertalanffy K coefficient, Pauly's method based on growth parameters and water temperature and methods based just on K. It is possible to combine two independent methods by computing a weighted mean but the improvement over the tmax-based methods is slight. Based on cross-validation prediction error, model residual patterns, model parsimony, and biological considerations, we recommend the use of a tmax-based estimator (M=4.899t-0.916max\ensuremath{<}mml:math\ensuremath{><}mml:mi\ensuremath{>}M\ensuremath{<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mo\ensuremath{>}=\ensuremath{<}/mml:mo\ensuremath{><}mml:mn\ensuremath{>}4.899\ensuremath{<}/mml:mn\ensuremath{><}mml:msubsup\ensuremath{><}mml:mi\ensuremath{>}t\ensuremath{<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:mo movablelimits="true"\ensuremath{>}max\ensuremath{<}/mml:mo\ensuremath{><}/mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:mo\ensuremath{>}-\ensuremath{<}/mml:mo\ensuremath{><}mml:mn\ensuremath{>}0.916\ensuremath{<}/mml:mn\ensuremath{><}/mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}/mml:msubsup\ensuremath{><}/mml:math\ensuremath{>}, prediction error = 0.32) when possible and a growth-based method (M=4.118K0.73L-0.33\ensuremath{\infty{}<}mml:math\ensuremath{><}mml:mi\ensuremath{>}M\ensuremath{<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mo\ensuremath{>}=\ensuremath{<}/mml:mo\ensuremath{><}mml:mn\ensuremath{>}4.118\ensuremath{<}/mml:mn\ensuremath{><}mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:msup\ensuremath{><}mml:mi\ensuremath{>}K\ensuremath{<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:mn\ensuremath{>}0.73\ensuremath{<}/mml:mn\ensuremath{><}/mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}/mml:msup\ensuremath{><}/mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:msubsup\ensuremath{><}mml:mi\ensuremath{>}L\ensuremath{<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"\ensuremath{>\infty{}<}/mml:mi\ensuremath{><}mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}mml:mo\ensuremath{>}-\ensuremath{<}/mml:mo\ensuremath{><}mml:mn\ensuremath{>}0.33\ensuremath{<}/mml:mn\ensuremath{><}/mml:mrow\ensuremath{><}/mml:msubsup\ensuremath{><}/mml:math\ensuremath{>} , prediction error = 0.6) otherwise.},

  abstract = {The age distribution of a random sample, or the "catch curve" from a stationary animal or fish population, provides information on the annual survival rate of the population. The usual assumptions imply that the age distribution in such a population is geometric. The best (minimum variance unbiased) estimate of the annual survival rate is X\=[1 + X\= - (1/n)]-1, X\= being the mean age and n the sample size. This estimate is compared to the so-called "Jackson" estimate and some modifications of Jackson's estimate. Assumptions basic to regression estimates of the survival rate are considered. A test of the model is given for the particular case where it is suspected that there may be selection against younger ages. With the geometric age distribution there is no unbiased estimate of i, the instantaneous mortality rate, but a nearly unbiased estimate is given by i* = ln [1 + X\= - (1/n)] - ln X\= - [(n - 1)(n - 2)/n(t + 1)(n + t - 1)] where t = nX\=.},

  abstract = {The argument persists that the continued overexploitation by many fisheries around the world is evidence that current approaches to fisheries management are failing, and that more precautionary management approaches are needed. We review the available estimates of the status of fish stocks from three sources: the FAO's \textquotedblleft{}State of Marine Resources\textquotedblright{}, a database on scientific stock assessments, and recent estimates from statistical models designed to determine the status of unassessed fish stocks. The two key results are (i) that stocks that are scientifically assessed are in better shape and indeed are not typically declining but rebuilding, and (ii) that large stocks appear to be in better shape than small stocks. These results support the view that stocks that are managed are improving, while stocks that are not managed are not. Large stocks receive far more management attention than small stocks in jurisdictions that have active fisheries management systems, and most unassessed stocks are simply not managed. We assert that fisheries management as currently practised can (and often does) lead to sustainable fisheries, and what is needed is to actively manage the unassessed fisheries of the world. More precautionary management is not necessarily needed to ensure the sustainability of managed fisheries.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been increasingly proposed, evaluated and implemented as management tools for achieving both fisheries and conservation objectives in aquatic ecosystems. However, there is a challenge associated with the application of MPAs in marine resource management with respect to the consequences to traditional systems of monitoring and managing fisheries resources. The place-based paradigm of MPAs can complicate the population-based paradigm of most fisheries stock assessments. In this review, we identify the potential complications that could result from both existing and future MPAs to the science and management systems currently in place for meeting conventional fisheries management objectives. The intent is not to evaluate the effects of implementing MPAs on fisheries yields, or even to consider the extent to which MPAs may achieve conservation oriented objectives, but rather to evaluate the consequences of MPA implementation on the ability to monitor and assess fishery resources consistent with existing methods and legislative mandates. Although examples are drawn primarily from groundfish fisheries on the West Coast of the USA, the lessons are broadly applicable to management systems worldwide, particularly those in which there exists the institutional infrastructure for managing resources based on quantitative assessments of resource status and productivity.},
