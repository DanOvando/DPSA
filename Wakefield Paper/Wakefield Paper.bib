Generic management procedures for data-poor fisheries: forecasting with few data. {\textendash} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst232. The majority of fish stocks worldwide are not managed quantitatively as they lack sufficient data, particularly a direct index of abundance, on which to base an assessment. Often these stocks are relatively ``low value'', which renders dedicated scientific management too costly, and a generic solution is therefore desirable. A management procedure (MP) approach is suggested where simple harvest control rules are simulation tested to check robustness to uncertainties. The aim of this analysis is to test some very simple ``off-the-shelf'' MPs that could be applied to groups of data-poor stocks which share similar key characteristics in terms of status and demographic parameters. For this initial investigation, a selection of empirical MPs is simulation tested over a wide range of operating models (OMs) representing resources of medium productivity classified as severely depleted, to ascertain how well these different MPs perform. While the data-moderate MPs (based on an index of abundance) perform somewhat better than the data-limited ones (which lack such input) as would be expected, the latter nevertheless perform surprisingly well across wide ranges of uncertainty. These simple MPs could well provide the basis to develop candidate MPs to manage data-limited stocks, ensuring if not optimal, at least relatively stable sustainable future catches.},

  abstract = {Abstract We contrast two paradigms for fisheries management decision making: the ``assessment'' paradigm, which is based around stock assessments, and the ``procedural'' paradigm, which is based around management procedures. The assessment paradigm has difficulty in providing management for data-poor stocks, and we illustrate this in the New Zealand context. In contrast, the procedural paradigm has the potential to be useful for the data-poor stocks. However, to date, it has not served data-poor fisheries well because most of the development of management procedures has been for high-value, data-rich stocks. This may be because several aspects of the procedural paradigm are misunderstood or neglected. Giving appropriate attention to these aspects will improve the application of fisheries management procedures, particularly for data-poor stocks. For example, more attention needs to be given to the method for presenting evaluation results to decision makers in ways that more easily allow them to make trade-offs among multiple management objectives. We also argue that the design, evaluation, and selection of management procedures should be treated as an exercise in engineering, particularly by applying generic solutions to data-poor cases for which specific solutions are usually not readily developed.},

  abstract = {Australia has developed a Harvest Strategy Policy (HSP) for Commonwealth fisheries. A harvest strategy specifies the management actions necessary to achieve defined resource objectives in a given fishery, resulting in a formal and proactive management approach that is transparent to all stakeholders. The objectives of the HSP are defined in terms of target and limit biomass reference points, although proxies can be used. It is a significant challenge, therefore, to develop harvest strategies for most small fisheries, which are typically data-poor, have only basic or no formal stock assessments, and have low Gross Value of Production (GVP). For the small Commonwealth fisheries, even indirect biomass estimates are unavailable and, due to their low GVP, it is unlikely that relevant research will be undertaken to determine reliable biomass estimates in the foreseeable future. This paper provides insight into developing harvest strategy frameworks that reconcile the reality and limitations of small fisheries with the intent of the HSP: to cease or avoid overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, and to maintain stocks at levels corresponding to the maximum economic yield. The process of harvest strategy development is evaluated and general principles for the pragmatic development and implementation of harvest strategies for small, low-value, data-poor fisheries are considered. These general principles include (i) the development of sets of triggers with conservative response levels, with progressively higher data and analysis requirements at higher response levels, (ii) identifying data gathering protocols and subsequent simple analyses to better assess the fishery, (iii) archiving biological data for possible future analysis, and (iv) the use of spatial management, either as the main aspect of the harvest strategy or an augmentation with other measures. The value of an iterative approach involving stakeholders and managers is emphasized. The above principles are illustrated by three case studies from Australia's small Commonwealth fisheries: the Western Deepwater and North West Slope Trawl Fisheries, the Coral Sea Fishery, and the Bass Strait Central Zone Scallop Fishery.},

Many small-scale, nearshore fisheries lack the historical catch and survey information needed for conventional stock-assessment-based management. The potential use of the ratio of the density of fish outside a marine protected area to that inside it each year (the density ratio, DR) in a control rule is evaluated to determine the direction and magnitude of change in fishing effort in the next year. Management strategy evaluation was used to evaluate the performance of this DR control rule (DRCR) for a range of movement rates of larvae and adults and other biological scenarios, and the parameters of the control rule that maximized cumulative catch (over 95 years) for each scenario were found. The cumulative catch under the optimal DRCR was 90\% of the cumulative catch from an optimal constant effort rule (CER). A small range of parameter values for the DRCR produced 75\% or more of the cumulative catch produced from optimal CERs for a variety of assumptions about biology and initial stock status. The optimal DRCR was most sensitive to the movement patterns of larvae and adults and survey variability.},

Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64\% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt.

The reserve-based approach increased estimates of spawning potential while reducing YPR and had a consistent estimation bias of less than 15\%. Using the framework, we assessed a commercial fishery targeting grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) in southern California, USA and found that inclusion of reserves reduced the probability of overfishing.

  abstract = {Abstract The Magnuson{\textendash}Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires active management of all stocks at risk of overfishing or otherwise in need of conservation and management. In the Pacific Fishery Management Council groundfish fishery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help define stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments defined a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to fisheries. This work uses productivity{\textendash}susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundfish stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by first using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and flexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stock- and complex-specific management.

We review the available estimates of the status of fish stocks from three sources: the FAO's ``State of Marine Resources'', a database on scientific stock assessments, and recent estimates from statistical models designed to determine the status of unassessed fish stocks. The two key results are (i) that stocks that are scientifically assessed are in better shape and indeed are not typically declining but rebuilding, and (ii) that large stocks appear to be in better shape than small stocks. These results support the view that stocks that are managed are improving, while stocks that are not managed are not. Large stocks receive far more management attention than small stocks in jurisdictions that have active fisheries management systems, and most unassessed stocks are simply not managed. We assert that fisheries management as currently practised can (and often does) lead to sustainable fisheries, and what is needed is to actively manage the unassessed fisheries of the world. More precautionary management is not necessarily needed to ensure the sustainability of managed fisheries.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses of field studies have shown that biomass, density, species richness, and size of organisms protected by no-take marine reserves generally increase over time. The magnitude and timing of changes in these response variables, however, vary greatly and depend upon the taxonomic groups protected, size and type of reserve, oceanographic regime, and time since the reserve was implemented. We conducted collaborative, fishery-independent surveys of fishes for seven years in and near newly created marine protected areas (MPAs) in central California, USA. Results showed that initially most MPAs contained more and larger fishes than associated reference sites, likely due to differences in habitat quality. The differences between MPAs and reference sites did not greatly change over the seven years of our study, indicating that reserve benefits will be slow to accumulate in California's temperate eastern boundary current. Fishes in an older reserve that has been closed to fishing since 1973, however, were significantly more abundant and larger than those in associated reference sites. This indicates that reserve benefits are likely to accrue in the California Current ecosystem, but that 20 years or more may be needed to detect significant changes in response variables that are due to MPA implementation. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of fish recruitment patterns, long-term monitoring is needed to identify positive responses of fishes to protection in the diverse set of habitats in a dynamic eastern boundary current. Qualitative estimates of response variables, such as would be obtained from an expert opinion process, are unlikely to provide an accurate description of MPA performance. Similarly, using one species or one MPA as an indicator is unlikely to provide sufficient resolution to accurately describe the performance of multiple MPAs.},

For this initial investigation, a selection of empirical MPs is simulation tested over a wide range of operating models (OMs) representing resources of medium productivity classified as severely depleted, to ascertain how well these different MPs perform. While the data-moderate MPs (based on an index of abundance) perform somewhat better than the data-limited ones (which lack such input) as would be expected, the latter nevertheless perform surprisingly well across wide ranges of uncertainty. These simple MPs could well provide the basis to develop candidate MPs to manage data-limited stocks, ensuring if not optimal, at least relatively stable sustainable future catches.},
